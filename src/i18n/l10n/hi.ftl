### Source strings for iNaturalistReactNative

### Notes for Translators
### * See https://crowdin.com/project/inaturalistios/discussions/58 for notes
###   on this file format
###
### Notes for Developers
### * GroupComments (comments beginning w/ ##) are not allowed because all
###   strings in this file will be alphabetized and it's impossible to
###   determine where group comments should fit in.
### * Keys should match their content closesly but not exceed 100 chars
### * Try to annotate all strings with comments to provide context for
###   translators, especially for fragments and any situation where the
###   meaning is open to interpretation without context
### * Use different strings for synonyms, e.g. stop--noun and stop--verb, as
### * Use double dashes to make keys with the same values in English unique or
###   to otherwise annotate them, e.g. stop--noun or casual--quality-grade
###   these might have different translations in different languages
### * Accessibility hints are used by screen readers to describe what happens
###   when the user interacts with an element
###   (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619585-accessibilityhint).
###   The iOS Guidelines defines it as "A string that briefly describes the
###   result of performing an action on the accessibility element." We write
###   them in third person singular ending with a period.
