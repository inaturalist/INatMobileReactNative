Your username and password works on all sites that are part of the iNaturalist Network. If you choose to affiliate with a Network site, the local institutions that operate each site will also have access to your email address (only to communicate with you about site activities) and access to the true coordinates for observations that are publicly obscured or private. Note: Please do not experimentally change your affiliation if you have more than 1000 observations.
