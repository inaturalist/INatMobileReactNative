// Needed for react-native-vision-camera v3.3.1

// value would be fine for both platforms.
// However, on Android for the "native" pixelFormat I could not find any method or properties to
// transform the frame into a Bitmap which we need for the classifier currently.
// So we use the "yuv" pixelFormat which is the only one that works for now but less performant.

// This patch is used to determine the orientation prop for the Camera component.

// On iOS, the orientation prop is undocumented, but it does get used in a sense that the
// photo metadata shows the correct Orientation only if this prop is set.

// As of this version the photo from takePhoto is not oriented coming from the native side.
// E.g. if you take a photo in landscape-right and save it to camera roll directly from the
// vision camera, it will be tilted in the native photo app. So, on iOS, depending on the
// metadata of the photo the rotation needs to be set to 0 or 180.
// On Android, the rotation is derived from the device orientation at the time of taking the
// photo, because orientation is not yet supported in the library.

// Needed for react-native-vision-camera v3.3.1

// photo to a smaller local copy we keep in the app cache. Previously we had a flow where
// we would resize the original photo to a smaller version including rotation. Now, we
// rotate the original photo first with image-resizer separately to save to camera roll,
// and then resize this copy to a smaller version. In case the first step is redundant
// in the future, we keep this patch here to remind us to put the rotation back to resizing
// the smaller photo.
